Bybit Simple Market Maker
===================

This is a sample market making bot for [Bybit](https://www.bybit.com/en-US/).


Getting Started
---------------

1. Assuming you already have a Bybit account, generate API keys and secrets using [this guide](https://learn.bybit.com/bybit-guide/how-to-create-a-bybit-api-key/)
2. Swap your key/secret into the config file found in /config/bybit.yaml/
3. Install all packages required by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt' 
4. Input the contract details in the parameters.yaml file (tick size/lot size) according to the symbol you want to make
5. Alter the spreads, order sizes, offsets (any setting in the .yaml file) as you wish, even whilst the bot is live!

** Note, changing the primary data feed between Binance <-> Bybit will require a restart to the script **


Strategy Design/Overview
---------------

1. Prices from Bybit (and optionally Binance) are streamed into a common shared class
2. A market maker function generates quotes, with bias based on price based features
  * Multiple features work on comparing orderbook, trades & price behaviours to calculate skew
  * Prices and quantities are generated, with prices within a volatility range, and min/max quantity defined manually
  * The above leads to behaviour shown in examples below:
    * (Ex) If binance mid price is lower than then bybit mid price -> skew is negative -> asks are more concentrated near mid price than bids
    * (Ex) If binance price is higher than then bybit price -> skew is positive -> bids have more qty than asks
    * (Ex) If inventory is extremely long, quotes are killed on the long side to try neutralize the position
3. Orders are sent to the exchange via diff function, which minimizes rate limit usage to shift between order states

- Access to Binance data feeds (LOB/Trades)
